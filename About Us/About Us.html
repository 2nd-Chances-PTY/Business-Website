  <h2><u>Values</u></h2>
  
  <p><b>What do we stand for?</b></p>
  <li>Honesty. A sales person knows how to sell products and services but a great 
    sales person is honest about what he/she is selling.</li>
  
  <p><b>What behaviors do we value over all else?</b></p>
  <li>Honesty,Strong integrity and amazing work ethic.</li>
  
  <p><b>How will we conduct our activities to achieve our mission and vision?</b></p>
  <li>We will strive to give the customer what they want by listening more than 
      speaking simply because when you're speaking, you're not listening and
      doing our best to do what we're asked to do to help our community reach their 
      goals.
    </li>
  
  <p><b>How do we treat members of our own organization and community?</b></p>
  <li>With respect at all times. We understand that even though there may be times where
      we come across unruly members. We believe that, that is a reflection of them and not us so we shall
      simply lead by showing respect regardless.</li>

  <h2><u>Vision</u></h2>

<p><b>Where are we going moving forward?</b></p>

  left the majority of us in.</li>

<p><b>What do we want to achieve in the future?</b></p>
<li>Provide a platform not only online but in person for people to be able to start
    learning skills that would help them lead healthier lives or like what inspired
    the name of our comapany, give them a second chance at creating the life they  
    have always dreamed of living regardless of where they come from.
</li>
